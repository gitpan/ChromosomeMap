Chromosome::Map version 0.01
============================

The Chromosome::Map permit has been developed to automatically
generate chromosome map. You just have to define:
  - a chromosome object (start, end, name, units)
  - at least one track
  - element objects (i.e. markers with name and location)

Then, you add the track to the map object and add the elements
to the track object. You can manage different type of tracks:
markers tracks, interval track (i.e. for QTL interval) and 
feature track (i.e. %GC content)
